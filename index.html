<h1>The Windigo</h1>
<h2>Kaitlin Lim</h2>
<p>
  <br>Within a few indigenous cultures lurks the infamous Windigo. A large, human-like beast, “has been called an evil spirit that devours mankind”—the more it eats, the more it hungers (Kimmerer 306). It was often told as a tale to children so they would behave, but the Windigo is more than just a bedtime story. If anything, it is representative of a problem that is becoming increasingly urgent and a discourse that needs to occur.
  <br><br>The cautionary tale of the Windigo emphasizes selflessness. It stresses the importance of being generous and giving to other members of the community and “to build resistance against the insidious germ of taking too much” (Kimmerer 305). In fact, there is a little bit of Windigo inside every one of us, and it is incumbent on all of us to keep those Windigo-like, selfish tendencies in check.
  <br><br>But not all of us have, and it’s become especially prevalent with today’s current environmental climate—pun not intended. The money-fueled desires of people and powerful private corporations has resulted in the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, oil spills in oceans and gulfs, and natural disasters that have disproportionately affected poor communities, just to name a few. Our capitalistic, profit-driven culture has become one where “indulgent self-interest that [indigenous] people once held to be monstrous is now celebrated as success” (Kimmerer 308).
  <br><br>In the context of environmental ethics, the Windigo illustrates two key terms: partiality and anthropocentric ethics. Simply put, the Windigo itself represents our partiality to ourselves and our self-interests as opposed to a community or collective, whereas anthropocentric ethics facilitates a continued emphasis on the self. I will first be defining partiality and anthropocentric ethics, then illustrating how harmful they have been in an environmental context with a few case studies, and finishing with suggestions that we can do as individuals to abolish these Windigo tendencies.

<h1>Partiality and Anthropocentrism</h1>
<p>
  <br>Philosopher Simon Keller defines partiality as the situation where “your special relationships make a difference to the standards of assessment to which your acts are answerable” (Keller 3) If you are partial to someone, you are more likely to give them “special” treatment—whether that be bending the rules, adding extra effort, or making more sacrifices. The trolley problem is a good example of partiality at work: let’s say there’s a trolley barreling down the tracks, but there are five strangers tied on the tracks. You have the option to redirect the trolley’s route, but a loved one or a close family member is tied to the other set of tracks. Which route do you choose?
  <br><br>Partiality is what might make us choose the tracks that would kill five people over our loved one. Of course, it’s obviously very difficult for us to remove partiality from all aspects of our lives, and we shouldn’t hold everyone to the expectation that we’ll get rid of any partiality we might have in order to make the most ethically sound decisions. Despite this, though, it’s still important that we assess partiality in the greater scheme of corporate profit motivated by individual greed. That is, we must be aware of the partiality present in the decisions of corporations that prioritize individual profit over their workers’ wellbeing.
  <br><br>With this definition of partiality, we can then state that anthropocentric ethics—human-centered ethics—as a form of ethics partial towards humans. That is, “human beings and only human beings have moral standing,” so only humans can be morally wronged (Desjardins 105). In this case, “our duties, such as not to pollute, are duties regarding the environment, but they are not duties to the environment” (Desjardins 105). Because the environment itself cannot be morally wronged in anthropocentric ethics, people would only be morally obligated to carry out tasks that, in addition to helping the environment, will ultimately help the human. We would be making decisions not out of a greater concern for the environment, but a concern for our self-interests.
  <br><br>Anthropocentric ethics is extremely prevalent. Our societal emphasis on individualism and the self is a reflection of that. And because of the dominant anthropocentric mode of thought, we have become accustomed to putting ourselves at the top of the moral hierarchy, and we can do anything we want to our surroundings without fear of repercussions. This anthropocentrism—this partiality to ourselves—has, indeed, led to us devastating the environment without so much a second thought. Classic Windigo thinking!

<h1>Harm to Animals</h1>
<p>
  <br>This partial, anthropocentric way of thinking has had clear consequences in the natural world. One prominent example are the coral reefs across the globe, many of which have died out because of fluctuations in ocean temperatures and acidity levels. Corals, which are a conglomeration of skeletons made by tiny organisms called polyps, are admittedly very prone to harm. However, coral reefs serve as important components of the ocean’s ecosystem. Author Elizabeth Kolbert writes that “thousands—perhaps millions—of species have evolved to rely on coral reefs, either directly for protection or food, or indirectly, to prey on those species that come seeking protection or food” (Kolbert 130). Truly, coral reefs are the rainforests of the ocean, and they are a crucial component of many different aquatic ecosystems.
  <br><br>Coral reefs are currently dying at rapid rates because of two main factors: ocean acidification and warmer temperatures—both of which are a results of environmentally harmful human activity. The latter has especially caused a lot of damage to coral reefs around the world, causing a phenomenon called “coral bleaching” where corals lose vital microorganisms that help keep it alive, lose their colors, and eventually die. Coral bleaching is happening more rapidly and in a shorter timeframe, as there were “major bleaching events in 1998, 2005, and 2010, and the frequency and intensity of such events are expected to increase as global temperatures climb” (Kolbert 142).
  <br><br>In focusing on profit and individual gain, we have acted in ways that have facilitated the rise of oceanic acidity levels and global temperatures. Our anthropocentric Windigo thinking is to blame for the death of coral reefs and all of the unsavory consequences that come as a result.

<h1>Harm to Humans</h1>
<p>
  <br>But our anthropocentrism has harmed more than just animals. Climate change has also caused an influx of natural disasters around the world, wreaking havoc and destroying households. These natural disasters have also disproportionately affected poor communities and women of color.
  <br><br>For instance, let us consider hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which devastated the US Gulf Coast region in the early 2000s. A lot of people’s homes were destroyed in the aftermath, and many were left without jobs. The Gulf Coast area also has a high concentration of female-headed households. Thus, women were burdened with the weight of taking care of the family and securing a stable source of income, which left most “poorer, less able to find jobs and, therefore, less able to move back to their previous homes following the storm” (Harris 157). This is just one instance, but there have been similar narratives in many communities around the world. These struggles all highlight the way that our anthropocentric, Windigo way of thinking about the environment has affected communities (and some far more than others).

<h1>What Now?</h1>
<p>
  <br>Given the devastating ramifications of our anthropocentric ways of thinking, what can we do to address it? And at the same time, how can we reverse the environmental damage that we have done and are currently doing?
  <br><br>First, we must recognize the power of groups. As individuals, it might seem difficult to go about and try inciting change in the name of environmental justice. However, there are countless grassroots organizations, especially in indigenous communities, that have been able to generate movements and call for change. Author and environmentalist Winona LaDuke has participated in different grassroots organizations in her indigenous community, “winning many hard-fought victories on the local level. [They] have faced down huge waste dumps and multinational mining, lumber, and oil companies … [including] a moratorium on mining in the sacred hills of Northern Cheyenne, Blackfeet, and Crow territory; an international campaign that stopped the building of mega-dams in northern Canada; the restoration of thousands of acres of White Earth land in Minnesota; and the rebuilding of a nation in Hawai’i” (LaDuke 4). We can take these movements as examples for our own individual pursuits of environmental justice, and we can also contribute to organizations that already exist for these purposes. There is power in numbers, after all.
  <br><br>Additionally, we can change the way that we think about the environment in relation to ourselves. Our current anthropocentric way of thinking has led us to believe that humans are on top of the moral hierarchy, and we thus have the ability to manipulate the world around us without constraint. As we have seen, that is not and should not be the case. But changing the way we think about the environment requires rejecting our anthropocentric mode of thought. So how else can we think about the environment in a way that is more conducive to environmental conservation and environmental justice?
  <br><br>In his work “The Land Ethic,” author and environmentalist Aldo Leopold recommends that we do not view ourselves as a separate entity from the environment, but actually a part of it. Leopold describes the earth as a “sustained circuit, like a slowly augmented revolving fund of life” (Leopold 662). Energy flows through the circuit in the same way that it flows through a biological food web: predation, decomposition, and the like. In viewing the earth and its organisms as a large, complex web of energy, we then are not able to separate ourselves from the environment, but rather contribute to its complex entanglements. We no longer view the environment as something to be conquered or tamed, but rather something we are a part of and something that we respect. This relationship of respect then enables us to make decisions for the environment’s wellbeing instead of our own.
  <br><br>Granted, it’s not easy to deconstruct our anthropocentric way of thinking, but it is work that is necessary and required (and, I argue, even the first step) for environmental justice. We must no longer let the Windigo dominate our way of life. It has been at the expense of not only countless habitats and animals, but also people. We all have a direct stake in the environment, and we must all make sure to tame our inner Windigos.
